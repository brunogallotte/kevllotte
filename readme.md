# Kevllotte API

## Overview

This project is an API built using the Fastify microframework, following SOLID principles to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase. The API utilizes Prisma for database management and Zod for schema validation. The architecture adheres to repository patterns and factory patterns, promoting a modular and scalable design.

## Features

- **Fastify**: A high-performance, low-overhead web framework for Node.js.
- **Prisma**: A modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for managing PostgreSQL databases.
- **Zod**: A schema declaration and validation library to ensure data integrity.
- **SOLID Principles**: The project is structured to follow SOLID principles, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Repository Pattern**: A pattern to abstract the data layer, providing a flexible approach to data access and manipulation.
- **Factory Pattern**: A creational design pattern used to instantiate objects, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and promoting code reuse.

## Technologies Used

- **Fastify**: For building the API server.
- **Prisma**: For database ORM.
- **Zod**: For schema validation.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for this project.
